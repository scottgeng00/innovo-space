                  <h2 class="info">Crowdsourced Healthcare</h2>
                  <p>The methodology of the current U.S. healthcare system creates time-restricted access to professionals
                    relevant for oneâ€™s ailments, and this is especially true for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.
                    We seek to remedy this issue by using forums to collect medical knowledge from a variety of groups. The
                    key powerful feature of these forums is that our community will be able to provide the user with an
                    approximate diagnosis of ailments in a timely manner in an appreciable fraction of total patients. In the end,
                    this feature will give disadvantaged communities greater and more affordable access to medical information,
                    and will also be of use to the general community as a way to save the time for both themselves and doctors.</p>

                  <h2 class="info">Security & Encryption</h2>
                  <p>User privacy isn't just a bonus, it is our fundamental duty and reponsibility. When you log in into our platform, your password is salted and hashed 
                    using an irreversible PBKDF-SHA256 algorithm, which is then compared with a stored hash within our database. We never store your unencrypted passwords. 
                    Moreover, all traffic to our main site and forums is secured with the OpenSSL protocol. Moving forward, as we expand our platform to include more
                    sensitive patient data, we will utilize both an asymmetric RSA-256 cipher and an end-to-end encryption protocol to ensure that no one--not even us--can
                    see your data without your permission. Your data wiil always be safe with us.

                  <h2 class="info">Large Medical Database  </h2>
                  <p>A major limitation in the healthcare industry is the limited amount of large-scale datasets. This platform brings
                    together a community of patients and doctors who bring with them a rich treasure trove of data. When users <b>opt in</b> to data collection,
                    we can formulate large HIPPA-compliant sets of deidentified data that can greatly remedy this deficiency. This will be invaluable to doctors and researchers going forward,
                    allowing us to hasten the rate of the bioinformatics revolution. Moreover, it is also a <b><a href ="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-020-0303-2"> well-documented fact</a></b> that current datasets 
                    are systematically biased against minorities and disadvantaged communities. Our platform will reach these once-ignored voices.</p>

                    <h2 class="info">Volunteering Opportunities</h2>
                    <p>The core strength of this platform is the community that it builds. Whether you're a patient, doctor, or just someone who cares,
                      a community starts with you! Giving just a tiny bit your time can mean giving hundreds of people some peace of mind. We understand that doctors, nurses, and hospital staff have busy lives, so that's why we want you to join the platform and contribute whatever experiences or knowledge you have to help others in a similar situation.
                      We would love to have you in our community. Let's get innovating!

                    <p>Obviously, much work remains to be done. No lasting change is brought about with such a small action. However,
                      we have taken one step in the right direction. And we want to continue forward. As a start, all features of this
                      site can be strengthed via recruiting more and more patients, volunteers, and doctors. Our platform counts
                      on a large population to be as effective as possible. We would also like to work with hospitals to start making
                      our proposition a more common feature in United States healthcare, and hopefully, we can one day deploy it internationally.
                      So, from all of us here at the Innovo team, we warmly welcome you aboard this journey forward.
